# __Object Detection Getting Started__

This project provides a real-time embedded environment for STM32 microcontrollers to execute [STEdgeAI](https://www.st.com/en/development-tools/stedgeai-core.html) generated models, specifically targeting the object detection application. The code prioritizes clarity and understandability over performance, making it an ideal starting point for further development.

![Image sample](_htmresc/sample.PNG)  
Detected classes and confidence level are displayed on the bounding boxes.

This is a standalone project that can be deployed directly to hardware. It is also integrated into the [ST ModelZoo repository](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services), and is required to deploy the object detection use case. The ModelZoo enables you to train, evaluate, and automatically deploy any supported model. If you wish to use this project as part of the ModelZoo, please refer to the [Quickstart using stm32ai-modelzoo-services](#quickstart-using-stm32ai-modelzoo-services) section for instructions.

This README provides an overview of the application. Additional documentation is available in the [Doc](./Doc/) folder.

## Boot Modes

The STM32N6 series does not have internal flash memory. To retain firmware after a reboot, program it into the external flash. Alternatively, you can load firmware directly into SRAM (development mode), but note that the program will be lost if the board is powered off in this mode.

Development Mode: used for loading firmware into RAM during a debug session or for programming firmware into external flash.

Boot from Flash: used to boot firmware from external flash.

## Quickstart using stm32ai-modelzoo-services

This application is a C-based project required by the deployment service in the [ModelZoo](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/tree/main). The ModelZoo enables you to train, evaluate, and automatically deploy any supported model.

To deploy your model using the ModelZoo, refer to the [Deployment README for STM32N6](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/blob/main/object_detection/deployment/README_STM32N6.md) for detailed instructions on deploying to either the STM32N6570-DK or the NUCLEO-N657X0-Q.

__Note__: This C-based application is already included in the ModelZoo repository under [STM32N6 object detection application code folder](https://github.com/STMicroelectronics/stm32ai-modelzoo-services/tree/main/application_code/object_detection/STM32N6).

## Quickstart using Prebuilt Binaries

### STM32N6570-DK

To program the board's external flash, follow these steps:

1. Set the board to [development mode](#boot-modes).
2. Program `Binary/ai_fsbl.hex` (First Stage Boot Loader).
3. Program `Binary/STM32N6570-DK_network_data.hex` (network parameters; only required when the network changes).
4. Program `Binary/STM32N6570-DK_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex` (firmware application).
5. Set the board to [boot from flash mode](#boot-modes).
6. Power cycle the board.

__Note__: The `Binary/STM32N6570-DK_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex` firmware is built for MB1939 STM32N6570-DK REV C02 with any of the listed camera modules.

### NUCLEO-N657X0-Q

To program the board's external flash, follow these steps:

1. Set the board to [development mode](#boot-modes).
2. Program `Binary/ai_fsbl.hex` (First Stage Boot Loader).
3. Program `Binary/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q_network_data.hex` (network parameters; only required when the network changes).
4. Program `Binary/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex` (firmware application).
5. Set the board to [boot from flash mode](#boot-modes).
6. Connect a USB cable to the USB OTG port (CN8), next to the RJ45 port. Connect the other end to a USB host (PC, USB hub, etc.) for data transmission via USB/UVC.
7. Power cycle the board.
8. Start the camera application on the host. On Windows, search for "camera" in the Start menu.

__Note__: The `Binary/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex` firmware is built for MB1940 NUCLEO-N657X0-Q REV C01 with USB/UVC host display and any of the listed camera modules.

### How to Program Hex Files Using STM32CubeProgrammer UI

See [How to program hex files STM32CubeProgrammer](Doc/Program-Hex-Files-STM32CubeProgrammer.md).

---

### How to Program Hex Files on STM32N6570-DK Using Command Line

Ensure the STM32CubeProgrammer `bin` folder is in your PATH.

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

# First Stage Boot Loader
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/ai_fsbl.hex

# Network parameters and biases
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/STM32N6570-DK_network_data.hex

# Application Firmware
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w Binary/STM32N6570-DK_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex
```

---

### How to Program Hex Files on NUCLEO-N657X0-Q Using Command Line

Ensure the STM32CubeProgrammer `bin` folder is in your PATH.

```bash
export NUEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX25UM51245G_STM32N6570-NUCLEO.stldr"

# First Stage Boot Loader
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w Binary/ai_fsbl.hex

# Network parameters and biases
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w Binary/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q_network_data.hex

# Application Firmware
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w Binary/NUCLEO-N657X0-Q_GettingStarted_ObjectDetection.hex
```

---

## Quickstart using Source Code

Before building and running the application, you must program `<board_name>_network_data.hex` (model weights and biases). This only needs to be done once unless you change the AI model. See [Quickstart using prebuilt binaries](#quickstart-using-prebuilt-binaries) for details.

For more information about boot modes, see [Boot Overview](Doc/Boot-Overview.md).

__Note__: To select the NUCLEO-N657X0-Q display interface, use the appropriate build configuration in CubeIDE, or specify `SCR_LIB_SCREEN_ITF=UVCL` or `SCR_LIB_SCREEN_ITF=SPI` as a Makefile option (default is UVCL).

---

### Application Build and Run - Dev Mode

Set your board to [development mode](#development-mode).

#### STM32CubeIDE

Double-click `Application/<board_name>/STM32CubeIDE/.project` to open the project in STM32CubeIDE. Build and run the project.

#### Makefile

Navigate to `Application/<board_name>/` and run the following commands (ensure required tools are in your PATH):

1. Build the project:
    ```bash
    make -j8
    ```
2. Start a GDB server connected to the STM32 target:
    ```bash
    ST-LINK_gdbserver -p 61234 -l 1 -d -s -cp <path-to-stm32cubeprogramer-bin-dir> -m 1 -g
    ```
3. In a separate terminal, launch a GDB session to load the firmware:
    ```bash
    $ arm-none-eabi-gdb build/Application/<board_name>/Project.elf
    (gdb) target remote :61234
    (gdb) monitor reset
    (gdb) load
    (gdb) continue
    ```

---

### Application Build and Run - Boot from Flash

Set your board to [development mode](#development-mode).

#### Build the Application

##### STM32CubeIDE

Double-click `Application/<board_name>/STM32CubeIDE/.project` to open the project in STM32CubeIDE. Build and run the project.

##### Makefile

Ensure all required tools are in your PATH, then build the project:

```bash
make -j8
```

#### Program the Firmware in the External Flash

After building the application, you can add a signature to the binary file:

```bash
STM32_SigningTool_CLI -bin build/Application/<board_name>/Project.bin -nk -t ssbl -hv 2.3 -o build/Application/<board_name>/Project_sign.bin
```

Program the signed binary at address `0x70100000`.

On STM32N6570-DK:

```bash
export DKEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX66UW1G45G_STM32N6570-DK.stldr"

# Adjust build path as needed
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $DKEL -hardRst -w build/Application/<board_name>/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000
```

On NUCLEO-N657X0-Q:

```bash
export NUEL="<STM32CubeProgrammer_N6 Install Folder>/bin/ExternalLoader/MX25UM51245G_STM32N6570-NUCLEO.stldr"

# Adjust build path as needed
STM32_Programmer_CLI -c port=SWD mode=HOTPLUG -el $NUEL -hardRst -w build/Application/<board_name>/Project_sign.bin 0x70100000
```

__Note__: Only the application binary needs to be programmed if `fsbl` and `network_data.hex` have already been programmed.

Set your board to [boot from flash](#boot-from-flash) mode and power cycle to boot from external flash.
